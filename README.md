android-cjj just directly use the library xml file R.anim.snailanim ,and I think we should not do that.
so I change the library file SnailBar.java .Change the method "onAttachedToWindow" to bellow:

```java
AnimationDrawable drawable = (AnimationDrawable)this.getResources().getDrawable(R.anim.snailanim); 
this.setThumb(drawable); 
drawable.start();
```

=====================================bellow is the origin description==================================

Hi Guys! 

This 18 seconds long animation demonstrates cool progressbar in action. I created it at leisure. You can download the PSD here:

I called it Helixbar. It could've been a Snailbar, but I like Helixbar :) 
Hope you like it.

how to use ?
-------------------------------------------------------
in layout.xml
```xml
   <com.cjj.SnailBar
            android:id="@+id/seekBar"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:thumb="@anim/snailanim" />
```
SnailBar is a subclass of Seekbar, so you can use it like Seekbar
```java
  seekBar = (SeekBar) findViewById(R.id.seekBar);
  ```
